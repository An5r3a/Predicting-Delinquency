Case Study

The objective of this case study is to create a delinquency model which can predict in terms of probabilities for each loan transaction, whether a consumer will be delinquent on his mortgage repayments in the next month. 
Delinquency is a condition that arises when an activity or situation does not occur at its schedule or expected date; that is, it occurs later than expected.
